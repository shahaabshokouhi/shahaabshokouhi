## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the University of New Hampshire working on **distributed multi-agent SLAM and autonomous navigation in unknown environments**.  
My work spans **robot perception, control, and learning**, with hands-on experience deploying real-time systems on embedded robotic platforms.

I focus on **building systems that actually run**: from SLAM pipelines and RL-based navigation to control architectures and multi-agent coordination.
